Kaggle competition site: https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting

Process to reproduce the solution:

* create a /submissions directory under the Kaggle directory

* create a /input directory under the Kaggle directrory, and download competition data stage 2 into it

* run the keras-kf-12-stage2-sept-10.ipynb notebook.  This should produce several files in the submissions directory, including:
     * keras_kf_12_stage2_sept_10_train.csv
     * keras_kf_12_stage2_sept_10_test.csv
      
* The file keras_kf_12_stage2_sept_10_test.csv is my first submission.  It scores 36.91121 and would have got the 4th rank overall.
